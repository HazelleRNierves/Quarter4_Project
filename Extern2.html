 <h2>Rising of sea level</h2>
   <p>With the extreme increase of temperature occurring around us we are able to ascertain the cause of rising sea levels. The rise of sea levels is from the slow melting of icebergs that also affected other factors in the environment. The organisms living in arctic regions such as polar bears are considered endangered species from the cause of rising sea levels.</p>
   <p>Numerous scientists from across the world began protesting the rise of sea levels due to the cause of climate change during the year of 2022 and still continues to this day. The rise of sea levels will not only affect the endangered species in cold regions but also the shores on land. If the rising sea levels continue to increase, there will be more water present to earth than land.

 <h3>Agricultural Drought</h3>
   <p>The impacts of climate change don't only result in the rise of sea levels but also cause agricultural  drought. The extreme temperature and the changes of weather pattern is partially the worries of many farmers as it can lead to drought. Drought occurs when there is a lack of moisture into the soil and can interfere or damage the growth of crops. The lack of moisture of the soil would be difficult for farmers to gain income due to the lack of harvest of crops. The lack of harvest would then lead to the shortage of food and the worse outcome can lead to hunger.
