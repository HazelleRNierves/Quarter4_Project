 <h2>What is climate change ?</h2>
   <p>Climate change is regarded as one of the great world problems faced by our society today, including the wildlife society. To give a proper idea of climate change, it is the change of temperature, seasons, and weather over a long period of time. There are factors that cause climate change that would be natural, in which the activities of the sun change, and others can be natural phenomena or manmade.</p>
   <p>Some factors that exaggeratingly cause climate change are the serious man-made activities created by our modern society today. Fossil fuels, deforestation, and other factors that relate to greenhouse gas emissions, which is the release of carbon dioxide into the air. Some of these factors could also create a domino effect that doesn't only result in the change of climate but to other instances as well, such as air pollution, that can lead to the cause of diseases.
